A plugin that allows you to create and use templates in order to facilitate writing of similar posts/pages.

== Description ==

It happens quite often that a blogger publishes posts or static pages on a regular basis which have the same structure. Think about for example a "picture of the day" daily post. With current wordpress state, we need to spend a lot of time doing copy/paste between posts instead of actually writing content. 

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://post-templates.vincentprat.info).

*IMPORTANT: LICENSE CHANGE*

Since version 4.0.0, the plugin has become a commercial plugin. It can be ordered (for cheap) on the [plugin home page](http://post-templates.vincentprat.info). 

Version 3.4.x will remain available for download for free on the WordPress plugin repository. 

*CHANGES*

Version 4.1.0: you can now duplicate posts, pages and templates, set capabilities directly from the settings page (no use of the role manager plugin anymore), news feed of the plugin included in its settings page.

Version 4.0.0: added custom fields, added page template, correction of some broken links in the template edition page, some minor style improvements.
